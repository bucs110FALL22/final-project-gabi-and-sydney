## Project Description

<< Give an overview of your project >>

***    

## User Interface Design

- **Initial Concept**
  - << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components. >>
    
    
- **Final GUI**
  - << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design

* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. 
         For each additional module you should include
         - url for the module documentation
         - a short description of the module >>
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm. >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg) 
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>
